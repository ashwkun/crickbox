    "text": "**Head's Heroics Power Australia to 5-Wicket Triumph**\n\nTravis Head’s blistering 163 and a match-defining 29 in the chase handed Australia a commanding 5-wicket victory over England. England posted 384 and 342, with Joe Root (160) and Jacob Bethell (154) shining, but Australia’s 567, bolstered by Head and Steve Smith’s 138, set the tone. Chasing 161, Australia cruised despite Josh Tongue’s fiery 3/42. The final overs were a breeze, with steady scoring—7 off Carse in the 132nd proving decisive—as Head’s men sealed the deal in style. Head, deservedly, was Player of the Match.",

    "text": "**Joel Davies dazzles as Sixers cruise past Stars**  \n\nSydney Sixers stamped their authority with a clinical chase, beating Melbourne Stars by 6 wickets. Joel Davies shone with the ball, snaring 2/15 in a disciplined effort, while Ben Dwarshuis’ fiery 4/13 dismantled the Stars for a modest 128. Josh Philippe’s brisk 35 (25) set the tone for the chase, and despite some economical work from Marcus Stoinis (2/20), the Stars couldn’t stop the Sixers from sealing it with 17 balls to spare. A 14-run over off Stoinis in the 17th extinguished any hopes of a late twist.",

    "text": "**Nathan Ellis and Liam Scott shine, but Hurricanes blow Strikers away**  \n\nHobart Hurricanes triumphed over Adelaide Strikers by 37 runs, riding on a clinical bowling effort led by Player of the Match Nathan Ellis (2/7). Defending 178, the Hurricanes dismantled the Strikers’ top order early, reducing them to 1/4 inside three overs. Liam Scott’s valiant 91 off 58 kept the chase alive, but he found no allies in a limp batting effort. Rishad Hossain’s crafty 3/26 tightened the screws, while Ellis’s death-over precision sealed the deal. Earlier, Mitchell Owen’s 33 off 9 powered the Hurricanes to a competitive total despite Tabraiz Shamsi’s miserly spell (1/19).",

    "text": "**De Klerk’s all-round brilliance sinks Mumbai in a final-over heist**  \n\nNadine De Klerk starred with bat and ball as Royal Challengers Bengaluru pulled off a thrilling 3-wicket win over Mumbai Indians. Chasing 155, RCB needed 31 off the last 2 overs, but Nat Sciver-Brunt’s wayward final over leaked 20 runs, including a six and a streaky four from De Klerk, who smashed a match-defining 63 off 44. Earlier, De Klerk’s fiery 4/26 choked Mumbai’s middle order, despite Sajana Sajeevan’s breezy 45. Amelia Kerr’s miserly 2/13 went in vain as Mumbai’s death bowling unraveled when it mattered the most.",
