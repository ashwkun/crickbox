England’s Joe Root (160) and Jacob Bethell (154) fought valiantly across their two innings, totaling 384 and 342, but Australia’s mammoth 567, bolstered by Steve Smith’s 138, built an unassailable lead. Chasing 161 in the fourth innings, Head (29) and Marnus Labuschagne (37) steered the ship, despite Josh Tongue’s fiery 3/42. The finish was clinical—16 runs in the last four overs sealed the deal with minimal fuss.",

Melbourne Stars stumbled to 128 despite promising starts from Stoinis and Macdonald, undone by regular strikes.
