    "text": "**Head’s Heroics Power Australia to 5-Wicket Triumph Over England**\n\nTravis Head’s blistering 163 in the first innings and a nervy 29 in the chase anchored Australia to a gritty 5-wicket win over England. England fought hard, with Joe Root’s 160 and Jacob Bethell’s defiant 154 setting imposing totals of 384 and 342. But Australia’s 567, powered by Head and Steve Smith’s 138, built an unassailable lead. The chase of 161 was tense, with Josh Tongue’s 3/42 rattling nerves, but Australia sealed it in the 31st over, despite late wickets, finishing with 3 runs off Will Jacks. Head, deservedly, was Player of the Match.",

    "text": "**Davies dazzles as Sixers cruise past Stars**  \n\nJoel Davies' all-round brilliance powered the Sydney Sixers to a comfortable six-wicket win over the Melbourne Stars. Chasing a modest 129, the Sixers were clinical despite a sluggish start. Josh Philippe's brisk 35 off 25 got them going before Lachlan Shaw sealed the deal with an explosive 24 off 14. The Stars’ bowlers lacked bite, with Marcus Stoinis (2/20) the lone bright spot. Earlier, Davies (2/15) and Ben Dwarshuis (4/13) dismantled the Stars, who stumbled to 128 all out. A 14-run 17th over from Stoinis extinguished any hopes of a late twist.",

    "text": "**Ellis and Hurricanes breeze past Strikers by 37 runs**  \n\nA fiery spell from Nathan Ellis (2/7 in 2 overs) and a relentless Hurricanes bowling attack suffocated the Strikers, defending 178 with ease. Despite Liam Scott’s valiant 91 off 58, the rest of the Strikers’ batting imploded like a deck of cards, with four wickets falling in the powerplay for just 1 run. Rishad Hossain (3/26) and Riley Meredith (2/16) kept the pressure on, while Mitchell Owen’s late blitz (33 off 9) earlier gave the Hurricanes the cushion they needed. Strikers needed 54 in the last 5 overs but fizzled out, sealed by Ellis’ clinical night.",

    "text": "**De Klerk's all-round heroics stun Mumbai in last-over heist**  \n\nNadine De Klerk (63 off 44, 4/26) scripted a stunning all-round performance to propel Royal Challengers Bengaluru to a thrilling 3-wicket win over Mumbai Indians. Chasing 155, RCB wobbled at 137/7 after a double strike by Nicola Carey in the 17th over. But De Klerk held her nerve, smashing Nat Sciver-Brunt for 20 runs in an ice-cold final over. Earlier, Mumbai’s Sajana Sajeevan (45 off 25) and Nicola Carey (40 off 29) set a competitive total, but De Klerk’s four-wicket burst derailed their momentum. RCB’s death-overs flourish sealed the deal in a nail-biter.",
