    "text": "**Rodrigues and Lee sizzle as Delhi cruise past Gujarat**  \n\nDelhi Capitals made light work of Gujarat Giants’ 168/7, chasing it down with 26 balls to spare. Lizelle Lee’s blistering 43 off 24 set the tone, while Jemimah Rodrigues (41 off 23) finished things off with her trademark elegance. Gujarat’s bowlers were taken to the cleaners early, with back-to-back big overs in the Powerplay (17 and 21 runs) leaving them gasping. Georgia Wareham’s 2/28 provided a glimmer, but it was too little, too late. Earlier, Beth Mooney’s patient 62 went in vain as Gujarat fell well short of a par score.",
