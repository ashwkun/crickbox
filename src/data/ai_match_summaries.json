    "text": "**Head's Heroics Power Australia to 5-Wicket Triumph**\n\nTravis Head’s blazing 163 and a gritty 29 in the chase headlined Australia’s commanding 5-wicket victory over England. England’s Joe Root (160) and Jacob Bethell (154) fought hard across two innings, but Australia’s batting depth, with Steve Smith’s 138 and Head’s fireworks, proved too much. The chase of 161 was a breeze, wrapped up in 31.2 overs despite Josh Tongue’s fiery 3/42. The final overs saw steady scoring—7 off Carse in the 132nd stood out—sealing a clinical win for the Aussies, with Head rightfully Player of the Match.",

    "text": "**Dwarshuis and Davies dismantle Stars to seal Sixers' commanding win**  \n\nSydney Sixers cruised to a six-wicket victory over Melbourne Stars, thanks to a clinical bowling display led by Ben Dwarshuis (4/13) and Joel Davies (2/15). The Stars stumbled to 128 all out, with only fleeting resistance from Marcus Stoinis and Blake Macdonald, as Dwarshuis spun a web. In reply, Josh Philippe's brisk 35 and Lachlan Shaw's late cameo (24 off 14) ensured a comfortable chase. Despite Stoinis' tidy spell (2/20), a 14-run 17th over off his bowling sealed the deal for the Sixers with 17 balls to spare, as Davies capped his all-round day in style.",

    "text": "**Nathan Ellis torments Strikers as Hurricanes cruise to 37-run win**  \n\nHobart Hurricanes outclassed Adelaide Strikers by 37 runs, courtesy of a clinical bowling display led by Nathan Ellis (2/7). Chasing 179, the Strikers crumbled early, losing four wickets inside three overs for just a run. Liam Scott’s heroic 91 off 58 was a lone battle, but the target always looked distant. Rishad Hossain (3/26) and Riley Meredith (2/16) ensured there was no miracle.  \n\nEarlier, Mitchell Owen’s blistering 33 off 9 and Rehan Ahmed’s handy 29 lifted the Hurricanes to 178/6. The Strikers simply never recovered from their woeful start.",

    "text": "**De Klerk's all-round brilliance powers RCB to a nervy win**  \n\nNadine De Klerk (63 off 44, 4/26) was the headline act as Royal Challengers Bengaluru eked out a 3-wicket win over Mumbai Indians in a rollercoaster finish. Chasing 155, RCB wobbled at 137/7 after a double strike from Nicola Carey in the 17th over, but De Klerk stood tall. With 20 needed off the final over, Nat Sciver-Brunt's wayward bowling (a six and two wides) gave RCB the breathing room they needed. Earlier, Mumbai's Sajana Sajeevan (45 off 25) sparkled, but De Klerk's four-for kept them in check.",
